# Arcade Game Clone - Udacity Project 3
---
## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to get acquainted with Object Oriented JavaScript to create a Frogger game clone. As provided by the Udacity project rubric, students were to create player and enemy entity classes that would spawn on the canvas. The enemy entities move across the board. The player entity is controlled by the end-user who will use the arrow keys to navigate to avoid the enemies. The object of the game is to clear all the levels and complete level 10. 

A live demo of the game can be used [here](http://udacity.foxifly.net/FroggerClone/Arcade%20Game%20Clone/)

## Installation 
To get started, you can either clone this repo, or download the zip file of the project. To run the game, you will double click the 'index.html' file. This will open up the game in your broser. 

## How To Play
To play this game, you will use your arrow keys to navigate the submarine in the ocean. Once you get to the top of the water, that level is considered complete and a new level starts. if you run out of lives before 

## Future Plans
I would like to create a more established score system. I want to be able to generate gems that the submarine can pick up and collect extra points. I would also like to spawn hearts, too. I got started on working on this, but never got around to completing it. I would also like my octopus sprite to show backwards when it is moving backward. 

## Sources
I designed all of the entities and canvas elements on this version. Starter code and project guidelines were provided by Udacity. This project was completed for the Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree.
